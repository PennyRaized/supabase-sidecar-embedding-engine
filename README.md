# Supabase Sidecar Embedding Engine

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

*A production-ready, zero-cost architecture for processing document embeddings at scale using a sidecar pattern on Supabase.*

## 🎯 What This Project Solves

Processing embeddings for large document corpora traditionally requires expensive infrastructure like Celery workers, Redis queues, and Kubernetes—often costing $500+/month. This project demonstrates how to achieve the same results using only Supabase's built-in capabilities.

## 🏗️ Coming Soon

- Complete setup instructions and documentation
- Architecture diagrams and technical deep-dive
- Performance benchmarks and cost analysis
- Live demo showcasing autonomous processing
- Step-by-step migration guide

## 📋 Project Status

This project is currently being extracted and adapted from a production MVP that processes 100K+ company embeddings for a hybrid search system. The core architecture has been battle-tested in production and demonstrates:

- Zero-cost scaling using Supabase's database extensions
- Autonomous processing with self-invoking Edge Functions
- Sidecar architecture for performance at scale
- Production-ready error handling and monitoring

## 🔄 Development Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core system extraction and adaptation
- **Week 2**: Generalization and abstraction
- **Week 3**: Documentation and visual assets
- **Week 4**: Final polish and public release
